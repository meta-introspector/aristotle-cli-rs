# The `L²` inner product of symmetric elements is real

`inner_symmetric_im_eq_zero` says this for *functions*; Gram–Schmidt runs on `L²`, so the same fact
is needed for the inner product of `Lp` elements. The upgrade needs genuine measure-preservation of
`u ↦ -u` on the restricted measure, rather than an a.e. transport, because a change of variables
inside an integral is involved rather than a null-set argument.

With this, "the Gram–Schmidt coefficients are real" becomes a fact about the ambient space, which is
what lets the process stay inside `symmetricSubspace`.
