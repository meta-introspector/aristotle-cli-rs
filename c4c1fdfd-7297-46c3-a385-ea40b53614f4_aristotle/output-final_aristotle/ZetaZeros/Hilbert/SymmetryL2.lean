# Symmetry on `L²`, as a real subspace

Pointwise symmetry cannot be carried into `L²` unchanged: elements of `Lp` are equivalence classes,
so the property must be stated almost everywhere. Doing so needs one genuinely new ingredient — an
a.e. statement has to be transportable through `u ↦ -u`, which holds because negation preserves
Lebesgue measure and `Ioo (-lam) lam` is reflection-invariant.

Once that is available the symmetric elements form an **ℝ**-subspace. Not a `ℂ`-one: multiplying by
`i` sends `conj (f u) = f (-u)` to `conj (i · f u) = -i · conj (f u)`, which fails. That is exactly
the structure the Gram–Schmidt argument needs, since its coefficients are real by
`inner_symmetric_im_eq_zero` and so it never leaves the subspace.
