# The `zz_tag` attribute

`@[zz_tag "TAG"]` records which numbered result of the source paper a declaration formalizes, `TAG`
being that result's label (`def_f_z`, `lem_bessel_F`, `prop_simple_real_lower`, `thm_simple`, ...).
It is the analogue of Mathlib's `@[stacks TAG]`.

The tag goes on **every** declaration whose union states the result's content, not merely the first;
scaffolding — helper definitions, hypothesis bundles, proof-local lemmas — stays untagged.

/-- `@[zz_tag "TAG"]` records which result of the source paper a declaration formalizes.

The syntax node is named `zzTag`, not `zz_tag`: the user-facing *token* keeps the underscore, to
match `@[stacks …]`, but Mathlib's `defsWithUnderscore` linter inspects the declaration name, so the
internal name must be lowerCamelCase. -/
