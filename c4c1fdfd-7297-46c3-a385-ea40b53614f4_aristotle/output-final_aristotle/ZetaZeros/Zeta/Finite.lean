# Finiteness of the zero set up to a height

The non-trivial zeros with imaginary part in `(0, T]` form a finite set, and each has positive
multiplicity. This is what lets the rescaled zeros be a finite multiset, which every statement of
the key proposition requires.

It is discharged from Mathlib's `IsCompact.inter_riemannZetaZeros_finite`, since the region is
bounded.
