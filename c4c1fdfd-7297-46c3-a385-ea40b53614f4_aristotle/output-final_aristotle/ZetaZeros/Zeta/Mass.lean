# The extremal test function has total mass one

The normalisation that makes `f₀` a probability density, and hence makes the Montgomery–Taylor
constant the value of the pair-correlation functional at its self-convolution rather than a
multiple of it.

The constant `√2 sin(1/√2)` in the denominator of `f₀` is exactly what the substitution
`x ↦ √2 x` produces, which is why the mass comes out at one on the nose.
